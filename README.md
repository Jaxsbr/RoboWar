# Robo War
## 2.0

### Overview
This game was originaly written and hosted in a ASP.NET web forms application.
Migrating to free github hosting ment that the SQL database dependency would have to be dropped. All game specific logic was kept and menu and score tracking logic was removed.

This game was fun to play in a prototype phase and thus will become 2.0.
Version 2 of Robo War will incorporate cloud technology to assist with score tracking.
