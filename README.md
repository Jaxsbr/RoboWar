# Robo War
## 2.0

### Overview
This game was originaly written and hosted in a ASP.NET web forms application.
Migrating to free github hosting ment that the SQL database dependency would have to be dropped. All game specific logic was ported to a simple SPA application while menu and score tracking logic was removed.

This game was fun to play in a prototype phase and thus will become a 2.0 project.
